Since 2000, DOMA has roasted high quality, ethically- sourced,
direct-relationship coffees. As leaders in the Fair Trade movement,
they believe their business should be a positive force
in both the local and global economies. These guys
and gals know their coffee, their community and how
to have fun. Did we mention they bike to
work and grow vegetables outside their office doors?
