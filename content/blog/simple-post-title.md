Southern folks really know their stuff
when it comes to tea. So it was
no surprise to learn this Kentucky-based
company just received the prestigous
"best overall iced tea" award from the
Tea Time magazine tasting team earlier
this summer. One sip and we were sold.
This isn't your grandmother's tea
(but we bet she'll love it too.)
